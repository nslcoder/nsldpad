I was supposed to write and publish in this blog a long time ago. I created this to have a place where I share my learning notes and also document my journey. But, as I kept on learning, I found it pretty hard to sit still and write down. I got lazy to write. But not anymore. This is the first post and there will be many more to follow.

Two things pushed me into the world of programming: money and ability to create entire websites and apps.

I didn't think anyone could be a programmer unless they had gone to the university or were gifted since childhood. Then I read a story of some normal guy who learned programming on his own and got a job. I read countless similar articles after that and it made me think I could do it. I liked that if one can devote time, equipped with computer and Internet, and perseverance, one could do wonderful things with programming.

Knowing that I could learn programming wasn't enough. It was the money and the upward mobility that came with this field which pushed me into it. I've been working in the tourism industry for more than 6 years and I haven't seen any expected significant progress, so I was looking for a way out. I felt programming is the right direction to take. It's already over a year since I started learning and I know many things now that I didn't know back then. I'm aware that not everyone makes money but programming gives opportunities that don't exist in the industry I'm currently in.

The other thing that attracted me is how one person can make an entire website or app and do amazing things with it. To a person who doesn't understand the underlying mechanics, it felt like magic. I dreamt a future where I will have multiple products online; some will make me money, some won't, and some will help me make a difference. The dream is still alive in me.

I've a long road ahead. I know the basics. I'm continuously learning and updating and upping my skills and knowledge. I hope I won't give up that easily and will eventually land a job, and move closer and close to my goal of being a full-fledged programmer.
